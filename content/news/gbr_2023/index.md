# GbR 2023 ! 

Together with Paul Honeine, Luc Brun and the two PhD students Stevan Stanovic et
Clément Gledel, we have two papers accepted in IAPR TC 15 conference :
Graph-based Representations for Pattern Recognition which will be held in
Salerno next september.

The two papers are : 
 - **Graph Normalizing Flows to Pre-image Free Machine Learning for Regression**,
   with **Clément Gledel** and Paul Honeine on the definition of machine learning
   models operating on graphs without the problem of preimage, hence bringing
   explicability to our models. 
 - **Maximal Independent Sets for Pooling in Graph Neural Networks** with **Stevan
   Stanovic** and Luc Brun on the definition of new pooling operators for GNN
   where the sampling is based on MIS on graphs, hence providing a span of the
   graph while performing its coarsening.

Links to code and paper will be added soon.
