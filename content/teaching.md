# Teaching activities
Most of my teaching activities are done at [INSA Rouen
Normandie](https://www.insa-rouen.fr/), within the computer engineering
([ITI](https://www.insa-rouen.fr/formation/specialites-ingenieurses/informatique-et-technologie-de-linformation))
department.

Here a list with ressources to my principal courses.

* [Analyse Num√©rique](https://moodle.insa-rouen.fr/course/view.php?id=159)

A course given at [UFAZ](https://www.ufaz.az/), a Franco-Azerbaijani university. It
